## Making Your Picks

This is where the strategy happens! Each race weekend, you must submit your picks before the deadline.

### Pick Structure

For each race, you select:

| Selection | Quantity | Class | Usage Limit |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| **A Teams** | 2 | Class A | 10 uses per team/season |
| **B Team** | 1 | Class B | 5 uses per team/season |
| **A Drivers** | 3 | Class A | 8 uses per driver/season |
| **B Drivers** | 2 | Class B | 5 uses per driver/season |
| **Fastest Lap** | 1 | Any Driver | Unlimited |

### Class A Teams (2026 Season)
- McLaren
- Mercedes
- Red Bull Racing
- Ferrari
- Williams

### Class B Teams (2026 Season)
- Racing Bulls
- Aston Martin
- Haas F1 Team
- Audi F1 Team
- Alpine
- Cadillac F1 Team

### How to Submit Picks

1. **Navigate to Picks** - Click the Picks icon in the navigation
2. **Select the Event** - Choose the upcoming race weekend
3. **Pick Your Teams** - Tap each team slot to open the selector
4. **Pick Your Drivers** - Select drivers from each class
5. **Choose Fastest Lap** - Pick who you think will set the fastest lap
6. **Lock In Picks** - Click "Lock In Picks" to submit

### Understanding Usage Limits

Usage limits create strategy throughout the season. You can't just pick the same winning team every race!

**Example:** If you pick McLaren for 10 different races, you've "used up" McLaren and cannot select them for remaining races.

**Usage Meters** show your remaining uses:
- Green = Plenty of uses left
- Yellow = Getting low
- Red = Maxed out (cannot select)

### Pick Deadlines

- Picks lock at **Qualifying start time** (typically Saturday)
- Sprint weekend picks lock at **Sprint Qualifying start time** (Friday)
- All times displayed in **Eastern Time (ET)**
- Late submissions are NOT accepted (unless you're an admin)

### Tips for New Players

1. **Spread Your A Teams** - Don't use all 10 uses of one team in the first 10 races
2. **Watch the Calendar** - Save strong teams for races where they historically perform well
3. **Track Mid-Pack Teams** - B Class teams can score big points at the right circuits
4. **Fastest Lap is Free** - Use this to score extra points with no usage penalty

## Understanding the Leaderboard

The Leaderboard shows where you stand in the championship race!

### Leaderboard Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Rank** | Your current position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) |
| **Team Name** | Your display name |
| **Total Points** | Cumulative points across all races |
| **GP** | Points from Grand Prix finishes |
| **Sprint** | Points from Sprint Race finishes |
| **Quali** | Points from Qualifying sessions |
| **FL** | Points from Fastest Lap predictions |

### How Points Are Calculated

Your total score is the sum of all your selected drivers' and teams' performance:

#### Grand Prix Points (Top 10)
| Position | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th | 9th | 10th |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|
| Points | 25 | 18 | 15 | 12 | 10 | 8 | 6 | 4 | 2 | 1 |

#### Sprint Race Points (Top 8)
| Position | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Points | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |

#### Qualifying Points (Top 3)
| Position | P1 | P2 | P3 |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|
| Points | 3 | 2 | 1 |

#### Fastest Lap Bonus
- **3 points** if your predicted driver sets the fastest lap

### Team vs Driver Scoring

- **Team Score** = Combined points of BOTH team drivers
- **Driver Score** = Individual driver's finishing position points

**Example:** You pick McLaren as a team. Norris finishes P1 (25 pts) and Piastri finishes P4 (12 pts). Your McLaren team earns you **37 points** for that Grand Prix.

### Prize Structure

| Place | Prize |
|-------|-------|
| 1st | $1,500 |
| 2nd | $750 |
| 3rd | $500 |

Remaining funds go to charity!
